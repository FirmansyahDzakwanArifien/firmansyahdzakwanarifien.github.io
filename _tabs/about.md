## About Me

I'm Firmansyah, an Informatics Engineering student at STT Terpadu Nurul Fikri deeply passionate about cybersecurity and infrastructure security. My journey in tech has been driven by a genuine curiosity about how systems work and how to secure them effectively. I learn best through hands-on experience—whether that's working in a SOC environment, managing Linux systems, or building secure infrastructure.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work across multiple domains: from security operations and threat monitoring to system administration and cloud infrastructure. Currently, I'm working as an Implementation Engineer at PT Jarvis Integrasi Solusi, where I help design and deploy robust solutions for clients. Beyond my day-to-day work, I lead the Nurul Fikri Student Cybersecurity Community and teach practical Incident Response courses, which allows me to share knowledge with the next generation of security professionals.
