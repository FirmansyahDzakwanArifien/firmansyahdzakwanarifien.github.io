{: .prompt-tip }

## Training Experience

### The Challenge of 4 Major Exams

Throughout the 6 months, we faced 4 comprehensive examinations that tested:

1. **Theoretical Knowledge**: Understanding security concepts and methodologies
2. **Technical Skills**: Hands-on exploitation and vulnerability assessment
3. **Reporting Abilities**: Professional documentation of findings
4. **Problem-Solving**: Real-world scenario-based challenges

Each exam was designed to ensure students could apply knowledge practically, not just memorize concepts.

### Live Training Sessions

The mandatory live sessions ensured:
- Real-time interaction with instructors
- Collaborative learning with peers
- Immediate clarification of complex topics
- Accountability and consistent progress

> Attendance requirements kept everyone engaged and prevented the common pitfall of online courses: procrastination.
{: .prompt-info }

### Practical Lab Environment

Students received access to:
- **Free VPS Ubuntu Server** for practice
- Custom subdomain with HTTPS
- Full root SSH access
- Realistic vulnerable applications
- Professional penetration testing tools

This infrastructure, provided by **X-code (PT. Teknologi Server Indonesia)**, enabled hands-on practice in a safe, legal environment.

## Key Skills Acquired

Through this intensive training, I developed competencies in:

### Web Application Security Testing

```bash
# Core Skills Developed:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- SQL Injection (manual & automated)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Authentication & Session Management attacks
- Business Logic flaws identification
- API security testing
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
- Insecure Deserialization exploitation
```

### Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

- Passive reconnaissance techniques
- Active enumeration methodologies
- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
- Subdomain discovery
- Technology fingerprinting
- Vulnerability scanning and analysis

### Exploitation & Post-Exploitation

- Web shell deployment
- Privilege escalation techniques
- Lateral movement strategies
- Maintaining persistence
- Data exfiltration methods
- Covering tracks and cleanup

### Professional Reporting

- Executive summary writing
- Technical finding documentation
- Risk assessment and CVSS scoring
- Remediation recommendations
- Professional pentest report structure

## The "Try Harder" Mentality

One of the most valuable lessons from this OffSec-aligned training is the **"Try Harder"** philosophy:

- Persistent problem-solving when facing obstacles
- Creative thinking when conventional methods fail
- Thorough enumeration before giving up
- Research skills and documentation reading
- Community collaboration while maintaining ethical standards

This mindset extends beyond penetration testing and applies to any technical challenge in cybersecurity.

## Industry Support & Recognition

The program is backed by **X-code (PT. Teknologi Server Indonesia)**, a leading cybersecurity and cloud services company that provides:

- Infrastructure for training labs
- Industry insights and real-world scenarios

## Personal Reflection

Completing this bootcamp alongside my other cybersecurity training creates a comprehensive skill set:

| Training | Focus | Achievement |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| **SMTP 2025** | General Cybersecurity | High Distinction |
| **Cyber Sentinel** | Web Pentesting | Graduate (188/850+) |
| **Jarvis Academy** | System Administration | Grade A (All Levels) |
| **Red Hat RH134** | Enterprise Linux | 40 Credit Hours |
| **BlankOn** | Infrastructure | Core Contributor |

Each program complements the others:
- **SMTP 2025** provided broad security fundamentals
- **Cyber Sentinel** delivered deep penetration testing expertise
- **Jarvis & RH134** established strong system administration foundation
- **BlankOn** offers real-world infrastructure experience

## The Journey from 850+ to 188

The 22% graduation rate reflects the program's rigor. Success required:

1. **Consistent Attendance**: Missing live sessions meant falling behind
2. **Daily Practice**: Lab time beyond scheduled training
3. **Persistent Study**: Understanding concepts deeply, not superficially
4. **Exam Preparation**: Rigorous testing validated actual skills
5. **Community Support**: Helping and learning from peers
6. **Try Harder Mentality**: Never giving up when stuck

> The high attrition rate isn't about difficulty alone—it's about commitment. Those who treated it like a professional job graduated. Those who expected easy, passive learning didn't make it.
