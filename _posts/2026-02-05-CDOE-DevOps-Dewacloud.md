## About the Course

Completed the CDOE - Fundamental DevOps certification from Dewacloud Academy, covering essential DevOps principles, practices, and tooling for modern software development and operations.

## What I Learned

This certification provided comprehensive knowledge of DevOps fundamentals, including core principles and culture, CI/CD pipeline concepts, automation and infrastructure as code, and the importance of collaboration between development and operations teams.

On the technical side, I gained hands-on experience with version control using Git workflows, continuous integration and deployment processes, container basics with Docker, configuration management tools, and monitoring and logging practices essential for maintaining production systems.

The course also covered industry best practices such as Agile development methodologies, infrastructure automation techniques, security integration in DevOps (DevSecOps), performance optimization strategies, and effective incident management procedures.

## Why It Matters

DevOps practices have become essential in modern software development, enabling teams to achieve faster deployment cycles, improve collaboration across development and operations, and reduce deployment failures. Organizations implementing DevOps can recover quickly from incidents and deliver better product quality to their users. This certification provides the foundational knowledge needed to implement DevOps practices effectively in real-world projects and contribute to building more efficient development pipelines.
