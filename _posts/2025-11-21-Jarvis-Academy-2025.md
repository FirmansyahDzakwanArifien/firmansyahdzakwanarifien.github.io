## Introduction

Excited to share that I've successfully completed two significant milestones in my system administration journey: the **Jarvis Academy System Administrator Bootcamp** and **Red Hat System Administration II (RH134)** course. This intensive learning experience has equipped me with comprehensive skills in Linux system administration and enterprise-level infrastructure management.

## Jarvis Academy Bootcamp Experience

The bootcamp was structured into three progressive levels, each building upon the previous one. I'm proud to have achieved an **A grade** across all course levels.

### Fundamental Course (Grade: A)

The foundation started strong with three core areas:

- **Networking Fundamental**: Understanding the basics of computer networking, including data communication concepts and key network components
- **Linux Command & File**: Mastering essential Linux commands for system navigation, file and directory management, and effective terminal usage
- **Users, Groups & Process Control**: Learning fundamental user management, group administration, and process control mechanisms

> This phase was crucial in establishing a solid understanding of Linux-based system administration fundamentals.

### Intermediate Course (Grade: A)

The intermediate level dove deeper into system and network service management:

- **SSH, Networking & Services Control**: Advanced SSH usage, network control, and service management
- **File Systems & Productivity**: Managing file systems effectively and optimizing system productivity
- **Schedule Tasks & Logs**: Implementing task scheduling and performing comprehensive log analysis
- **Archive, Transfer & Performance**: Mastering data archival techniques, transfer methods, and performance monitoring
- **SELinux & Basic Storage**: Introduction to SELinux security framework and basic storage management

### Advanced Course (Grade: A)

The advanced level focused on enterprise-grade system and service management:

- **Storage Stack & NAS**: In-depth storage stack management and Network-Attached Storage (NAS) configuration
- **Boot Process & Network Security**: Understanding system boot processes and implementing robust network security measures
- **Installation & Containers**: System installation procedures and container management
- **Web Server**: Building and configuring production-ready web servers

> The progressive structure of the bootcamp ensured I built practical, job-ready skills at each level.

## Red Hat System Administration II (RH134)

Following the bootcamp, I attended the official Red Hat RH134 course (Version 9.3), completing **40 credit hours** of intensive training from September 26, 2025.

This course provided hands-on experience with:

- Advanced file system management
- Storage configuration and management
- Network service deployment
- Security implementation with SELinux
- System performance tuning
- Automation with shell scripting
- Troubleshooting complex system issues

The course aligned perfectly with my bootcamp training, reinforcing concepts while introducing Red Hat-specific best practices and enterprise scenarios.

## Key Takeaways

Through these programs, I've gained:

1. **Comprehensive Linux Skills**: From basic commands to advanced system administration
2. **Enterprise Best Practices**: Understanding industry-standard approaches to system management
3. **Security Mindset**: Implementing SELinux and network security measures
4. **Automation Capabilities**: Scheduling tasks and creating efficient workflows
5. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Troubleshooting and performance optimization techniques

## What's Next?

With this foundation, I'm now preparing for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** certification exam. The combination of Jarvis Academy's practical bootcamp and Red Hat's official training has provided me with the confidence and skills needed to pursue this industry-recognized certification.

I'm grateful to both **Jarvis Academy** and **Red Hat** for these exceptional learning opportunities. Special thanks to **April Rustianto** (Chairman of Jarvis Academy) and **Karl Reynolds** (Senior Director, Global Learning Services at Red Hat) for their commitment to quality technical education.
