## Introduction

I'm excited to share that I've recently joined the **BlankOn Revival Project** as a core contributor in the **Infrastructure Team**. BlankOn Linux is Indonesia's very own GNU/Linux distribution, designed specifically for Indonesian users with localized features and cultural elements that make computing more accessible to our communities.

## About BlankOn Linux

BlankOn Linux is not just another Linux distribution—it's a movement toward digital independence and technical competency in Indonesia. The name "BlankOn" itself carries a profound philosophy: the transformation from **blank** (empty) to **on** (filled/enlightened), representing the journey from unawareness to awareness, from consumer to producer.

### The Philosophy Behind BlankOn

The project embodies a powerful vision: transforming Indonesians from mere consumers of technology to producers and innovators. It's about changing the mindset from dependency on foreign products to creating our own solutions.

> **Blank → On**: The journey from emptiness to enlightenment, from consumer mentality to producer mentality.

### BlankOn's Relationship with Debian

BlankOn is a **Debian derivative distribution** that maintains 100% compatibility with Debian. This means:
- Applications for Debian can run on BlankOn
- BlankOn-specific applications can be installed on Debian
- BlankOn can be installed on top of existing Debian systems
- It's not just a remaster—it has its own packages and repositories

## The Mission: Building an Open Source Ecosystem

The BlankOn Project aims to develop a comprehensive ecosystem around free and open-source software by:

1. **Enhancing Local Talent**: Building competency in FOSS development—from technical aspects like application development and Linux distribution to non-technical skills like leadership and community building

2. **Creating a Self-Sustaining Ecosystem**: Bringing together individuals, educational institutions, companies, and organizations (nonprofit, commercial, and governmental) that use BlankOn as their foundation

3. **Transforming Mindsets**: Converting people from consumers to producers and innovators, encouraging them to create code, ideas, artwork, and profitable business ventures

4. **Perpetual Innovation**: Creating a perpetual motion of innovation that feeds back into the BlankOn project through funding, feedback, and manpower

## Looking Forward

Joining the BlankOn Revival Project as an infrastructure contributor is both an honor and a responsibility. I'm working alongside talented individuals who share the vision of digital independence for Indonesia.

This aligns perfectly with my broader journey in system administration and cybersecurity:
- **SMTP 2025**: Cybersecurity knowledge from Korean experts
- **Jarvis Academy**: System administration bootcamp
- **Red Hat RH134**: Enterprise Linux administration
- **BlankOn**: Infrastructure for Indonesian Linux distribution

Each experience builds upon the last, creating a comprehensive skill set that I can now apply to serve Indonesia's open-source community.

## Personal Reflection

The transformation from **blank to on** isn't just BlankOn's philosophy—it's my personal journey too. From learning Linux basics to now contributing to Indonesia's own distribution, from being a user to becoming a builder, this is exactly the kind of transformation BlankOn represents.

I'm committed to the mission of changing Indonesia's technology landscape from consumer-dependent to producer-innovative. Every commit, every infrastructure improvement, every collaboration brings us closer to that vision.
